# C Brainfuck Compiler

Having developed an interpreter in Lua, I thought I would give building a compiler a try.

## Running

Simply run `make`, which will generate the bf compiler + some programs.

## Scripts

All the bf scripts are of property of [daniel b cristofani](http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/).
